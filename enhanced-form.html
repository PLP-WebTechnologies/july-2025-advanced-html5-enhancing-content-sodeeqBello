            <h2>A Brief History of African Music</h2>
            <p>Music in Africa is more than just entertainment; it's a fundamental part of life, deeply interwoven with 
                social, religious, and political aspects of society. Its history is vast and diverse, mirroring the 
                continent's countless cultures. Traditionally, music was functional, serving a purpose in ceremonies, 
                rituals, and daily tasks. Oral tradition was key, with stories, history, and values passed down through songs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Musical instruments are equally diverse, ranging from percussion instruments like drums (djembe, 
                talking drums), xylophones (balafon), and rattles, to string instruments like the kora and mbira. 
                The music itself is often characterized by its polyrhythms (the simultaneous use of two or more contrasting 
                rhythms), call-and-response patterns, and improvisational elements).
            </p>
            <p>
                The 20th century saw a massive evolution. The influence of Western genres like jazz and blues, which 
                themselves have African roots, led to the creation of new sounds. Highlife from Ghana and Nigeria, soukous 
                from the Congo, and Jùjú music from Nigeria all emerged, blending traditional rhythms with modern 
                instrumentation like electric guitars and horns. In recent decades, a new wave of artists has brought 
                African music to a global stage, with genres like Afrobeats and Amapiano gaining international popularity.
